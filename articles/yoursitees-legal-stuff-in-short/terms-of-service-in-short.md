## Acceptance of Terms

**In short**

* By using YourSitee, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you don't agree to them, you may not use the service
* YourSitee has copyright and is protected by laws
* These Terms and conditions may change at any point, without notice
* You must be at least 13 years old to use YourSitee

## Content

* You are responsible for anything you post, not YourSitee
* When you post, you allow YourSitee to use, keep, show, and share your content. Your content might also be used for marketing if you agree
* The platform can delete your content anytime if it breaks the rules or is considered harmful
* Usernames cannot contain offensive language, explicit material, or swearing
* Recreating pages that were banned before (not due to inactivity) may result in a permanent ban

## Accounts and security

* If you create an account, you will need to provide an accurate and real email address, and when you lose your account, it's your own responsibility to recover it. You can change it on the dashboard
* Refunds within the platform will get your account deleted to prevent fraud
* If you (may) have been hacked, you should contact YourSitee immediately to resolve the issue
* It's your own responsibility to maintain access to the platform. For that reason, you agree to not share your password with anyone

## Links to other sites

* Links to other websites may be shared. YourSitee does not operate these external sites, and is therefore not responsible for the content
* It's your own responsibility for reading the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of any other website you visit

## No guarantee

* YourSitee is available on an "as is" basis
* The platform denies any (implied) guarantees, such as those related to selling, suitability for a particular use, and not violating intellectual property rights&#x20;

## Indemnification

* By using YourSitee, you promise to protect YourSitee and its team from any costs or damages that might come up because you use it. This includes things like legal fees
* You agree to take responsibility for any issues that come up from your access to the Platform, whether it's related to the law or someone else's rights
* Even if your account ends, this promise to protect us will still be in effect if it's necessary

## Personal data

* YourSitee values your personal information and will process it in accordance with the Privacy Policy

## Community Standard

* YourSitee's community standards define what is and what is not allowed on YourSitee. Not complying with them may get your account syspended or permanently banned

## Limited liability

* The Platform and its suppliers are not responsible for any damages, like losing data or profits, that happen from using or not being able to use our website materials, even if someone was told about the possibility of these damages
* If you live in a place where laws don’t allow limits on certain types of damages or warranties, these rules might not apply to you
* If something goes wrong while using our site, YourSitee can’t be held accountable for any losses you might face

## Governing law

* YourSitee's service rules are based on the laws of Hungary, where its offices are. Both sides agree to follow the legal system in Hungary
* If we don’t enforce a rule, it doesn’t mean we give up that right. If a court finds any part of these rules invalid, the rest will still be valid
* These rules are the complete agreement between you and us, replacing any earlier agreements about the Platform

## Resignation and cancellation

* You can delete your account at any time on the dashboard
* After deleting your account, your data will remain in the system until it is permanently removed
* You can ask for immediate removal by emailing contact@yoursit.ee

## International use

* If you use the Platform from outside Hungary, it's your choice, and you need to follow your local laws
* The Platform can be accessed globally, but we don't suggest using it in places where the content is not allowed

## Fees for use

* The Platform offers a mix of free and paid subscription options, allowing users to choose what works best for them
* Subscription fees are charged monthly or annually and will continue until you decide to cancel. If you switch plans, the cost will be changed based on the time left on your current plan
* To cancel your subscription, just go to your billing page. Generally, payments are not refundable, but there are exceptions for accidental changes if reported quickly
* YourSitee can remove or disable any account or subscription at any time without giving you a heads-up, and won’t be responsible for any issues that come from this
* Prices for subscriptions may change in the future, and YourSitee will inform active users via email at least 60 days before the new prices take effect. Remember, any extra taxes or fees from your country are your responsibility

## Legal information

* You cannot copy or duplicate the Platform, including its design and code, for commercial reasons. Doing so is against the law and can lead to serious consequences
* YourSitee and its partners do not guarantee that the Platform will always work perfectly or be available whenever you need it
* They also can't promise that any mistakes will be fixed or that the Platform is free from harmful software like viruses
* The results you get from using the Platform might not always meet your expectations, and the information provided may not be completely accurate or reliable
* These rules are enforced as much as the law allows, and they don’t take away any rights you might have under the Australian Consumer Law. If there’s a problem, they will either fix the service or give you a refund

## Feedback

* If you share your thoughts with us, we can use them however we want, and you won’t get paid for it
* Sometimes, YourSitee might let you try out new features on the Platform that are still in testing, called "beta.
* You understand that these beta features are still being checked and might not work as well as the other parts of the Platform. YourSitee keeps looking at and testing these beta features to make them better

## Non-Disclosure Agreement

* Sometimes, we might tell you secret information, like new features, if you help us test things out. You must keep this information a secret and safe.

## Contact us

* If you have any questions or suggestions about YourSitee's Terms of Service, you can content them at contact@yoursit.ee.
